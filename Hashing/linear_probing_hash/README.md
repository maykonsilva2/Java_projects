# Hash Repository

This repository contains an implementation of Open Addressing (Linear Probing) in Java. It serves as a reference for the implementation described on the website [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-hashing-chaining/).

## Introduction

Open Addressing is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables. In this implementation, we specifically use Linear Probing to handle collisions. Linear Probing is a simple method where if a collision occurs, we search for the next available slot in the hash table and insert the element there.
