# Hashing Repository

This repository was created to test and implement the concept of Separate Thread Hashing in Java. It serves as a reference for the implementation described in the website [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-hashing-chaining/).

## Introduction

Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size array, called a hash table, based on a specific key. It allows for efficient retrieval and storage of data by reducing the search time complexity to O(1) on average.

## Implementation

The code in this repository demonstrates the implementation of Separate Thread Hashing, which uses separate chaining to handle collisions. Separate chaining involves creating a linked list at each index of the hash table to store multiple elements with the same hash value.
